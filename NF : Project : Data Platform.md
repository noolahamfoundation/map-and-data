## Challenge
Various governmental units in Sri Lanka including Department of Census and Statistics and Open Data Iniative (data.gov.lk) make available various data sets to the public. However, there remains challenges in the following areas

* Accessibility - Some data formats cannot be used
* Lack of standards - Lacks metadata and not released under any Open Data standard
* Data Story and Context - Raw data is provided, context is missing
* Viusalization - Raw data is provided without visualization, which makes it difficult to use
* Missing data
* Data organization - We would like to organize data into issues or interests for policy development, advocacy etc.

## Objectives
* Identify and assess official data sources in areas of focus
* Get data at the smallest available geographic unit 
* Convert that data into a structured format
* Add metadata, provenance data and release the data according to an Open Data standard
* Provide the story, context, analysis, visualization to make use of that data
* Organize datasets into a data platform

## Areas of Focus
* Demographics (by nationality, by age, by religion, by income levels etc)
* Education (ex: educational attainment)
* Economic indicators (ex: income levels, single headed households)
* Health (ex: vaccination rate, life expectancy, infant mortality)
* Food Security & Agriculture & Fishery
* Water Security
* Enviorment
* Government Services
* Tranportation (ex: road coverage)
* Crime and Security
* Energy
* Community
